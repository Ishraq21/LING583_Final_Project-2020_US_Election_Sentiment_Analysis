**What I did?**

Pre-process and train my data using multiple different classifiers to predict the candidate from tweet text only. Furthermore, take into account the hashtags and how they are related to a certain candidate alongside the tweet texts to analyze the user sentiments and biases toward them. 

**What are the deliverables?**

The deliveries is a a Jupyter notebook in HTML and a link to the dataset. Not to mention there is also be a summary of the preprocessing methods, models, predictions, limitations and results at the end of my notebook.
